internal/infrastructure

This folder deals with interactions with external systems or resources, such as databases, external APIs, or file systems.

    url_repository.go: Implements the repository interface for storing and retrieving shortened URLs from a data store (e.g., a database). This file would contain methods for CRUD operations related to URLs.
    Other infrastructure-related files: If the URL shortener service interacts with external services (e.g., analytics, logging), you might have additional files here for handling those interactions.
